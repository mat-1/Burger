# The biome class specifically is an issue because in 18w06a, the old name is
# present in the biome's own class, but the ID is still in the register class.
# This stops being an issue later into 1.13 when biome names become translatable.

# Similarly, in 1.13, "bubble" is ambiguous between the particle class and
# particle list, but the particletypes topping works with the first result in that case.

# In 1.18-pre8, the "Getting block state" message now appears in both rendering
# code and world code, but in both cases the return type is correct.

# In 23w31a, a new configuration state was added with its own nethandler.
# disconnect.lost was in a base class for nethandler.client, while a new message
# (connect.reconfiging) was in nethandler.client itself. Unfortunately,
# Skipping Entity with id is still in nethandler.client, so matching that base
# class instead of the actual nethandler means two things match entity.list,
# with the wrong thing coming first.

# Also in 23w31a, the packet buffer class was split from the string encoder.
# Fortunately the packet buffer also comes first.

# In 24w06b, "Data value id is too big" appears both in metadata and an inner class of metadata.
# TODO: Including it here seems to fix things, though further testing is needed as the entities topping was broken in an earlier snapshot.
